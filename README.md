### Update your Nintendo Switch clock using a list of NTP servers

When using a custom DNS (or a limited connection), it might not be possible to update your clock using Nintendo servers, causing the Switch to get out of sync easily.

With this [Tesla](https://github.com/WerWolv/libtesla) plugin, you can now quickly update your clock using your custom [NTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Time_Protocol) servers!

## Features

- Update the time by selecting from a list of servers ([customizable!](#customize-servers))
- Show the current offset compared to the selected server
- Set the internal network time to the time set by the user in system settings (time traveling, yay!)

### Customize servers

Since v1.5.0, you can create or modify the provided `quickntp.ini` file, with the following syntax:

```ini
[Servers]
My_Ntp_Server = ntp.example.com
```

Underscores will be replaced by spaces in the UI!

The homebrew will look for the file with the following order priority:
- /config/quickntp.ini
- /config/quickntp/config.ini
- /switch/.overlays/quickntp.ini

**Note**: If the file is missing or invalid, only the `NTP Pool Main` server will be shown.

## Possible future features

- Better error handling / messages
- Show a clock with seconds
- Turn the heart icon into a clock (need to check the font)
- Get the time in a separate thread
- Pick the closest NTP server based on user region
- Update the time with milliseconds (may be a system limitation)

- [@SanketDG](https://github.com/SanketDG) for the [NTP Client](https://github.com/SanketDG/c-projects/blob/master/ntp-client.c) using `getaddrinfo` instead of `gethostbyname`

### Suggested NTP servers

- [NTP Pool Project](https://www.ntppool.org)
- [Cloudflare Time Services](https://www.cloudflare.com/time/)
- [Google Public NTP](https://developers.google.com/time)
- [NIST Internet Time Servers](https://tf.nist.gov/tf-cgi/servers.cgi)

## Troubleshooting

- The "Synchronize Clock via Internet" option should be enabled in System Settings [as described here](https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/22557/p/989/c/188), since this program changes the "Network clock" (which is immutable in settings).
- If the only server shown is `NTP Pool Main`, there is a problem with the `quickntp.ini` file located in the `config` directory on the SD card. More details [here](#customize-servers).

## Disclaimer

- Please don't send a lot of requests to public servers. NTP servers should only be queried at 36-hour intervals.
- This program changes the NetworkSystemClock, which may cause a desync between the console and servers. Use at your own risk!
